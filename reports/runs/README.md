# Local Run Artifacts

This directory stores local run roots and intermediate artifacts generated during iterative analysis.

Examples:
- `pi_v1_run60`
- `pi_v1_run60_fullnewspaper`
- `prototype_zoning_panel_analysis_iter*`

Policy:
- This directory is intentionally gitignored.
- Keep outputs here for local reproducibility and debugging.
- Promote only final, curated report bundles to `reports/` top-level tracked report folders.
