You are labeling a CLUSTER of extracted regulatory clauses from zoning / land-use documents.

Goal
- Produce a short, human-readable instrument label for the cluster (instrument_name).
- Provide an instrument_description that captures the core regulatory requirement type.
- Provide keywords that help identify the instrument in downstream tables/plots.

Critical rules
- Use ONLY the provided clause excerpts and metadata. Do NOT use outside knowledge.
- Do NOT invent requirements that are not present in the excerpts.
- If the cluster is mixed or too noisy to label, still pick the best instrument_name you can and explain uncertainty in notes.
- Never mention embeddings, clustering, UMAP, HDBSCAN, OCR, or “model”.

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY valid JSON matching:
{
  "cluster_id": <integer>,
  "instrument_name": "<2-8 words>",
  "instrument_description": "<1-4 sentences>",
  "keywords": ["<strings>"],
  "motive_hints": ["<0-4 from the REGULATORY_MOTIVES taxonomy>"],
  "notes": "<short string>"
}

You will be given:
- CLUSTER_ID
- Optional: cluster keywords (auto TF-IDF)
- A list of representative clauses, each with:
  - clause_text (verbatim quote)
  - requirement (normalized paraphrase)
  - modality, motive, instrument_hint
