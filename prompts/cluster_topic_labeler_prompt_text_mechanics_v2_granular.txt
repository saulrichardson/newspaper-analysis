You are analyzing clusters of newspaper text excerpts.
Many clusters contain zoning / land-use ordinance language, but some clusters may be mixed or non-zoning.

Goal
- Produce a cluster label that explains what the text is *doing* (regulatory mechanism), not just “zoning”.
- Produce structured mechanics tags (controlled vocabulary) that are granular enough to track how zoning changes over time.

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences) matching:
{
  "cluster_id": <integer>,
  "topic_name": <string>,
  "topic_description": <string>,
  "keywords": <array of strings>,
  "zoning_relevance": <"zoning" | "mixed" | "non_zoning">,
  "mechanics": {
    "action_tags": <array of strings>,
    "dimension_tags": <array of strings>,
    "decision_body_tags": <array of strings>,
    "instrument_tags": <array of strings>,
    "district_tokens": <array of strings>,
    "mechanism_phrases": <array of strings>,
    "evidence": <array of objects { "tag": <string>, "example_numbers": <array[int]> }>
  }
}

High-level guidance (granularity)
- If zoning_relevance="zoning", be specific enough that two different zoning mechanisms would NOT share the same tags.
- Prefer specific dimension tags like "setbacks", "lot_area", "dwelling_units", "parking", "signs", "nonconforming_uses" instead of broad words.
- Prefer mechanism_phrases that read like “what changed / what is regulated”.

Step 1: Decide zoning_relevance
- "zoning": dominant theme is zoning/land-use regulation or zoning decisions
- "mixed": zoning appears but is not dominant OR excerpts clearly cover multiple unrelated topics
- "non_zoning": clearly not zoning/land-use

Step 2: Create topic_name/topic_description
- topic_name must be 2–6 words.
- Avoid generic topic_name like “zoning law”, “zoning ordinance”, “zoning regulations”, “land use”, “municipal ordinances”.
- If zoning_relevance="zoning", topic_name MUST include a concrete mechanism noun (e.g., rezoning, variance, setbacks, districts, definitions, nonconforming).

Step 3: Fill mechanics tags (controlled vocabularies)
Use ONLY these exact strings:

action_tags
- adopt_ordinance
- amend_text
- amend_map_rezone
- annexation
- create_district
- create_overlay
- definitions
- nonconforming
- administration
- public_hearing_notice
- appeals
- variance
- conditional_use
- special_exception
- site_plan
- subdivision_plat
- pud
- enforcement_penalties
- permit_licensing
- fees

dimension_tags
- permitted_uses
- conditional_uses
- prohibited_uses
- setbacks
- yards
- lot_area
- lot_width
- building_height
- floor_area_ratio
- lot_coverage
- density
- dwelling_units
- parking
- loading
- signs
- billboards
- landscaping_buffers
- fences_walls
- accessory_structures
- home_occupations
- mobile_homes
- trailer_parks
- manufactured_housing
- districts
- definitions_terms
- nonconforming_uses
- subdivision_standards
- site_plan_requirements
- pud_standards
- floodplain
- airport
- adult_business
- alcohol
- historic_district
- utilities_sewer_water

decision_body_tags (if unclear use "unknown")
- city_council
- planning_commission
- zoning_board
- board_of_adjustment
- board_of_appeals
- county_commission
- town_board
- zoning_administrator
- unknown

instrument_tags
- ordinance
- resolution
- zoning_code
- zoning_map
- petition
- application
- permit
- notice
- hearing
- minutes
- report_recommendation
- affidavit_publication

district_tokens (free text but grounded; extract what you see)
- Provide 0–30 short tokens that name the zoning districts / overlays / zone codes mentioned.
- Examples: "R-1", "R-2", "C-2", "I-1", "A-1", "PBC", "BT", "floodplain overlay", "historic district".
- Do NOT include ordinance numbers, page numbers, deed book references, or other non-district identifiers (e.g., "Ordinance No. 205" is NOT a district token).
- If no district codes/names appear in the excerpts, return an empty list.

Granularity targets (do your best, do not invent)
- If zoning_relevance="zoning": aim for 2–5 action_tags and 5–12 dimension_tags where evidence supports them.
- If zoning_relevance="mixed": tags can be sparse; do not force zoning tags.
- If zoning_relevance="non_zoning": action_tags/dimension_tags may be empty lists; do not force zoning tags.

mechanism_phrases (free text but grounded; aim for richness)
- If zoning_relevance="zoning": provide 8–15 short phrases capturing the mechanics.
  Examples: “minimum lot area per dwelling unit”, “front-yard setback reduction”, “rezone parcel from residential to commercial”, “conditional use permit for mobile home park”, “nonconforming use continuation limits”, “zoning map amendment by ordinance”.
- Include numbers/units ONLY if clearly present in excerpts.
- If zoning_relevance is "mixed" or "non_zoning", mechanism_phrases may be empty or describe the dominant non-zoning mechanism.

evidence (required)
- For EACH tag you include in action_tags/dimension_tags/decision_body_tags/instrument_tags, add at least one evidence entry:
  { "tag": "<the tag>", "example_numbers": [<integers like 1,2,3>] }
- Use the example numbers ([EXAMPLE 1], [EXAMPLE 2], ...).
- Evidence must reflect what is actually in the excerpts; do not invent.

Never mention embeddings, clustering, UMAP, HDBSCAN, OCR, or “model”.
