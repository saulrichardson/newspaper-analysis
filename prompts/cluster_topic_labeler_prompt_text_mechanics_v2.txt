You are analyzing clusters of newspaper text excerpts.
Many clusters contain zoning / land-use ordinance language, but some clusters may be mixed or non-zoning.

Goal
- Produce a cluster label that explains what the text is *doing* (regulatory mechanism), not just “zoning”.
- Additionally, produce structured *mechanics tags* (controlled vocabulary) so we can analyze zoning mechanisms over time.

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences) matching:
{
  "cluster_id": <integer>,
  "topic_name": <string>,
  "topic_description": <string>,
  "keywords": <array of strings>,
  "zoning_relevance": <"zoning" | "mixed" | "non_zoning">,
  "mechanics": {
    "action_tags": <array of strings>,
    "dimension_tags": <array of strings>,
    "decision_body_tags": <array of strings>,
    "instrument_tags": <array of strings>,
    "district_tokens": <array of strings>,
    "mechanism_phrases": <array of strings>,
    "evidence": <array of objects { "tag": <string>, "example_numbers": <array[int]> }>
  }
}

How to think about "mechanics"
1) First decide zoning_relevance:
   - "zoning": the dominant theme is zoning/land-use regulation or zoning decisions
   - "mixed": multiple unrelated topics; zoning appears but is not dominant
   - "non_zoning": clearly not zoning/land-use

2) Then identify what is happening in the text:
   - Is it a map change (rezoning)?
   - A text amendment to the code?
   - A permit/variance/appeal process?
   - A definition/district structure section?
   - A substantive rule (setbacks, lot area, density, height, uses, parking, signs, etc.)?

Avoid generic labels
- Do NOT use topic_name like “zoning law”, “zoning ordinance”, “zoning regulations”, “land use”, “municipal ordinances”.
- If zoning_relevance="zoning", topic_name MUST include at least one concrete mechanism noun (e.g., setbacks, lot area, rezoning, variance, conditional use, districts, definitions, nonconforming, enforcement).

decision_body_tags (who is acting; choose all that apply; if unclear use "unknown")
- city_council
- planning_commission
- zoning_board
- board_of_adjustment
- board_of_appeals
- county_commission
- town_board
- zoning_administrator

instrument_tags (what kind of legal/procedural instrument; choose all that apply)
- ordinance
- resolution
- zoning_code
- zoning_map
- petition
- application
- permit
- notice
- hearing
- minutes
- report_recommendation
- affidavit_publication

district_tokens (free text but grounded; extract what you see)
- Provide 0–30 short tokens that name the zoning districts / overlays / zone codes mentioned.
- Examples: "R-1", "R-2", "C-2", "I-1", "A-1", "PBC", "BT", "floodplain overlay", "historic district".
- Do NOT include ordinance numbers, page numbers, deed book references, or other non-district identifiers (e.g., "Ordinance No. 205" is NOT a district token).
- If no district codes/names appear in the excerpts, return an empty list.

mechanism_phrases (free text, but MUST be grounded in the excerpts)
- Provide 4–12 short, concrete phrases describing the actual rule or action.
- Prefer phrases like “reduce front-yard setback”, “rezone parcel from R-1 to C-2”, “minimum lot area per dwelling unit”, “nonconforming use continuation rules”.
- Include numbers/units ONLY if clearly present.
- If zoning_relevance is "non_zoning", mechanism_phrases may be empty or describe the non-zoning mechanism.

evidence
- For EACH tag you include in action_tags/dimension_tags/decision_body_tags/instrument_tags, add at least one evidence entry:
  { "tag": "<the tag>", "example_numbers": [<integers like 1,2,3>] }
- Use the example numbers from the prompt ([EXAMPLE 1], [EXAMPLE 2], ...).
- Evidence must reflect what is actually in the excerpts; do not invent.

Never mention embeddings, clustering, UMAP, HDBSCAN, OCR, or “model”.
