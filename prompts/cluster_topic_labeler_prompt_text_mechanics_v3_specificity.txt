You are analyzing clusters of newspaper text excerpts.
Many clusters contain zoning / land-use ordinance language, but some clusters may be mixed or non-zoning.

Goal
- Produce a cluster label that explains what the text is *doing* (regulatory mechanism), not just “zoning”.
- Additionally, produce structured *mechanics tags* (controlled vocabulary) so we can analyze zoning mechanisms over time.

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences) matching:
{
  "cluster_id": <integer>,
  "topic_name": <string>,
  "topic_description": <string>,
  "keywords": <array of strings>,
  "zoning_relevance": <"zoning" | "mixed" | "non_zoning">,
  "mechanics": {
    "action_tags": <array of strings>,
    "dimension_tags": <array of strings>,
    "decision_body_tags": <array of strings>,
    "instrument_tags": <array of strings>,
    "district_tokens": <array of strings>,
    "mechanism_phrases": <array of strings>,
    "evidence": <array of objects { "tag": <string>, "example_numbers": <array[int]> }>
  }
}

How to think about "mechanics"
1) First decide zoning_relevance:
   - "zoning": the dominant theme is zoning/land-use regulation or zoning decisions
   - "mixed": multiple unrelated topics; zoning appears but is not dominant
   - "non_zoning": clearly not zoning/land-use

2) Then identify what is happening in the text:
   - Is it a map change (rezoning)?
   - A text amendment to the code?
   - A permit/variance/appeal process?
   - A definition/district structure section?
   - A substantive rule (setbacks, lot area, density, height, uses, parking, signs, etc.)?

Topic name: STRICT specificity rules (this is the most important part)
- topic_name must be plain English (no snake_case, no underscore tokens, no “amend_text:” prefixes).
- topic_name must describe a *specific mechanism* or *specific procedure*.
- topic_name should be short (aim: 6–12 words) and information-dense.

Hard bans (topic_name)
- Do NOT use topic_name that is just “zoning” or “zoning regulation(s)” or “zoning ordinance”.
- Do NOT use these generic patterns in topic_name (case-insensitive):
  - "zoning regulation"
  - "zoning regulations"
  - "zoning ordinance"
  - "zoning law"
  - "land use"
  - "municipal ordinance"
  - "adopt zoning"
  - "adoption of zoning"
  - "amend zoning ordinance"
  - "zoning ordinance amendment"
  - "zoning ordinance adoption"

If the cluster is about adoption/amendment, say *what* is adopted/amended
- BAD: "Adoption of town zoning ordinance via legal notice"
- GOOD: "Public hearing notice for adopting district map and use rules"
- BAD: "Amending zoning ordinance via public hearing"
- GOOD: "Public hearing notice to amend parking minimums and setbacks"
- BAD: "Adopt zoning regulations and map"
- GOOD: "Adopt zoning map: district classifications and permitted uses"

If the cluster is mostly procedural (not substantive), name the procedure explicitly
- Prefer: "public hearing notice", "petition/application", "planning commission recommendation", "council vote", "appeal/variance hearing", "affidavit of publication".
- This is still a valid “mechanism”: it tells us *how* zoning changes get processed.

If zoning_relevance="zoning", topic_name MUST contain at least one concrete mechanism noun
- Examples: rezoning, zoning map amendment, districts, permitted uses, setbacks, lot area, height, density, parking, signs, variance, conditional use, special exception, nonconforming use, subdivision, site plan, PUD, enforcement, fees.

Controlled vocabularies (use ONLY these exact strings)
action_tags (choose all that apply)

- public_hearing_notice
- appeals
- variance
- conditional_use
- special_exception
- site_plan
- subdivision_plat
- pud
- enforcement_penalties
- permit_licensing
- fees

dimension_tags (what the zoning is regulating; choose all that apply)
- permitted_uses
- conditional_uses
- prohibited_uses
- setbacks
- yards
- lot_area
- lot_width
- building_height
- floor_area_ratio
- lot_coverage
- density

- nonconforming_uses
- subdivision_standards
- site_plan_requirements
- pud_standards
- floodplain
- airport
- adult_business
- alcohol
- historic_district
- utilities_sewer_water

decision_body_tags (who is acting; choose all that apply; if unclear use "unknown")
- city_council
- planning_commission
- zoning_board
- board_of_adjustment
- board_of_appeals
- county_commission
- town_board
- zoning_administrator
- unknown

instrument_tags (what kind of legal/procedural instrument; choose all that apply)
- ordinance
- resolution
- zoning_code
- zoning_map
- petition
- application
- permit
- notice
- hearing
- minutes
- report_recommendation
- affidavit_publication

district_tokens (free text but grounded; extract what you see)
- Provide 0–30 short tokens that name the zoning districts / overlays / zone codes mentioned.
- Examples: "R-1", "R-2", "C-2", "I-1", "A-1", "PBC", "BT", "floodplain overlay", "historic district".
- Do NOT include ordinance numbers, page numbers, deed book references, or other non-district identifiers (e.g., "Ordinance No. 205" is NOT a district token).
- If no district codes/names appear in the excerpts, return an empty list.

mechanism_phrases (free text, but MUST be grounded in the excerpts)
- Provide 6–14 short, concrete phrases describing the actual rule or action.
- Prefer phrases like “reduce front-yard setback”, “rezone parcel from R-1 to C-2”, “minimum lot area per dwelling unit”, “nonconforming use continuation rules”.
- Include numbers/units ONLY if clearly present.
- If zoning_relevance is "non_zoning", mechanism_phrases may be empty or describe the non-zoning mechanism.

evidence
- For EACH tag you include in action_tags/dimension_tags/decision_body_tags/instrument_tags, add at least one evidence entry:
  { "tag": "<the tag>", "example_numbers": [<integers like 1,2,3>] }
- Use the example numbers from the prompt ([EXAMPLE 1], [EXAMPLE 2], ...).
- Evidence must reflect what is actually in the excerpts; do not invent.

Final self-check (do this BEFORE you output JSON)
- If topic_name contains any banned phrase above, rewrite it until it does not.
- If topic_name would still make sense if you delete all words except “zoning/ordinance/regulation”, it is too generic; rewrite it.
- Ensure topic_name is not snake_case and does not start with a raw tag name like "amend_text".

Never mention embeddings, clustering, UMAP, HDBSCAN, OCR, or “model”.
