You are analyzing clusters of newspaper text excerpts.
Many clusters contain zoning / land-use ordinance language, but some clusters may be mixed or non-zoning.

Goal
- Produce a cluster label that explains what the text is *doing* (regulatory mechanism), not just “zoning”.
- Additionally, produce structured *mechanics tags* (controlled vocabulary) so we can analyze zoning mechanisms over time.

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences) matching:
{
  "cluster_id": <integer>,
  "topic_name": <string>,
  "topic_description": <string>,
  "keywords": <array of strings>,
  "zoning_relevance": <"zoning" | "mixed" | "non_zoning">,
  "mechanics": {
    "action_tags": <array of strings>,
    "dimension_tags": <array of strings>,
    "decision_body_tags": <array of strings>,
    "instrument_tags": <array of strings>,
    "district_tokens": <array of strings>,
    "mechanism_phrases": <array of strings>,
    "evidence": <array of objects { "tag": <string>, "example_numbers": <array[int]> }>
  }
}

How to think about "mechanics"
1) First decide zoning_relevance:
   - "zoning": the dominant theme is zoning/land-use regulation or zoning decisions
   - "mixed": multiple unrelated topics; zoning appears but is not dominant
   - "non_zoning": clearly not zoning/land-use

2) Then identify what is happening in the text:
   - Is it a map change (rezoning)?
   - A text amendment to the code?
   - A permit/variance/appeal process?
   - A definition/district structure section?
   - A substantive rule (setbacks, lot area, density, height, uses, parking, signs, etc.)?

Topic name (topic_name): V4 strict specificity rules (most important)
- topic_name must be plain English (no snake_case, no underscore tokens, no prefixes like "amend_text:").
- topic_name should be short (aim: 6–12 words), information-dense, and mechanism-oriented.
- topic_name must NOT be a generic “this is zoning” label.

Generic-label prohibition (do NOT do this)
- Do NOT output topic_name that is basically just: zoning / ordinance / regulation / law.
- In particular, topic_name MUST NOT contain these phrases (case-insensitive):
  - "zoning ordinance"
  - "zoning regulations" or "zoning regulation"
  - "zoning law"
  - "land use"
  - "municipal ordinance"
  - "adopt zoning" / "adoption of zoning"

If the excerpts themselves repeatedly say those generic phrases (common in legal notices),
you still MUST NOT copy them into topic_name. Replace with a specific mechanism+content description.

Content anchor requirement (prevents bland labels)
If zoning_relevance="zoning", topic_name MUST include at least ONE concrete anchor from:
  A) A rule/dimension anchor: setbacks, lot size/lot area, height, density, dwelling units, parking, signs, permitted uses, conditional uses, nonconforming uses, subdivision standards, site plan requirements, PUD standards.
  B) A district/map anchor: rezoning, zoning map, district boundary, district classification, zone code tokens (e.g., R-1, C-2), overlay.
  C) A process/decision anchor (ONLY if the cluster is mostly procedural): variance hearing, conditional use hearing, special exception, appeal, planning commission recommendation, city council vote, referendum, affidavit of publication.

If the cluster is procedural and the excerpts do not include substantive details,
say so explicitly WITHOUT using generic zoning phrases.
- Example: "Affidavit of publication for rezoning hearing notice (details absent)"
- Example: "Public hearing notice for district map change (substance not specified)"

If the cluster is about adoption/amendment, say *what* is adopted/amended
- BAD: "Public hearing notice to adopt zoning ordinance provisions"
- GOOD: "Public hearing notice to adopt district map and permitted uses"
- BAD: "Public hearing notice to amend zoning ordinance"
- GOOD: "Public hearing notice to amend setbacks and parking minimums"

- appeals
- variance
- conditional_use
- special_exception
- site_plan
- subdivision_plat
- pud
- enforcement_penalties
- permit_licensing
- fees

dimension_tags (what the zoning is regulating; choose all that apply)
- permitted_uses
- conditional_uses
- prohibited_uses
- setbacks
- yards
- lot_area
- lot_width
- building_height
- floor_area_ratio
- lot_coverage

decision_body_tags (who is acting; choose all that apply; if unclear use "unknown")
- city_council
- planning_commission
- zoning_board
- board_of_adjustment
- board_of_appeals
- county_commission
- town_board
- zoning_administrator
- unknown

instrument_tags (what kind of legal/procedural instrument; choose all that apply)
- ordinance
- resolution
- zoning_code
- zoning_map
- petition
- application
- permit
- notice
- hearing
- minutes
- report_recommendation
- affidavit_publication

district_tokens (free text but grounded; extract what you see)
- Provide 0–30 short tokens that name the zoning districts / overlays / zone codes mentioned.
- Examples: "R-1", "R-2", "C-2", "I-1", "A-1", "PBC", "BT", "floodplain overlay", "historic district".
- Do NOT include ordinance numbers, page numbers, deed book references, or other non-district identifiers.

mechanism_phrases (free text, but MUST be grounded in the excerpts)
- Provide 6–14 short, concrete phrases describing the actual rule or action.
- Prefer phrases like “reduce front-yard setback”, “rezone parcel from R-1 to C-2”, “minimum lot area per dwelling unit”, “nonconforming use continuation rules”.
- Include numbers/units ONLY if clearly present.

evidence
- For EACH tag you include in action_tags/dimension_tags/decision_body_tags/instrument_tags, add at least one evidence entry:
  { "tag": "<the tag>", "example_numbers": [<integers like 1,2,3>] }
- Use the example numbers from the prompt ([EXAMPLE 1], [EXAMPLE 2], ...).
- Evidence must reflect what is actually in the excerpts; do not invent.

Final self-check (do this BEFORE you output JSON)
- If topic_name contains any generic phrase banned above, rewrite it until it does not.
- If topic_name would still make sense if you delete all words except generic words like “zoning/ordinance/regulation/law”, it is too generic; rewrite it.
- If zoning_relevance="zoning" and topic_name lacks a content anchor (rule/district/process specifics), rewrite it.
- Ensure topic_name is not snake_case and does not start with a raw tag name like "amend_text".

Never mention embeddings, clustering, UMAP, HDBSCAN, OCR, or “model”.
