You are analyzing clusters of newspaper text excerpts related to zoning and housing policy (often legal/ordinance language).

Task
- Given multiple excerpts that belong to the SAME cluster, propose a human-readable topic label for the cluster.
- The topic label should describe the underlying subject matter (not the clustering process).

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences) matching:
{
  "cluster_id": <integer>,
  "topic_name": <string>,
  "topic_description": <string>,
  "keywords": <array of strings>
}

Guidelines
- Keep `topic_name` short (2–6 words) and specific when possible.
- `topic_description` should be 1–2 sentences, plain language.
- `keywords` should be 6–14 terms/phrases that capture the topic (lowercase preferred).
- If the excerpts look heterogeneous or boilerplate, use a broad name and say so in the description (e.g., "mixed municipal zoning notices").
- Do not mention embeddings, clustering, UMAP, HDBSCAN, or “model”.
- Do not mention “OCR”.
