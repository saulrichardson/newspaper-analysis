# Scratch Workspace

Use this directory for temporary experiments, smoke tests, and ad-hoc local files.

Policy:
- `scratch/` is gitignored except this README.
- Do not place permanent analysis assets here.
- If an experiment becomes part of the workflow, move it into `scripts/`, `docs/`, or a curated report folder.
